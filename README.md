# Middleware-Learning
In Express.js, middleware functions act as intermediaries in the request-response cycle. They have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next() function, which is used to pass control to the subsequent middleware in the stack. 
Middleware functions can perform various tasks, including: Executing code, Modifying request and response objects, Ending the request-response cycle, and Calling the next middleware function in the stack.
Express distinguishes between application-level middleware, router-level middleware, error-handling middleware, and built-in middleware.
